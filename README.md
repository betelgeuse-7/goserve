# goserve
start an http file server

# RUN
- source build.sh
- cd to any directory
- run ./goserve from there

You can also add it to $PATH if you want.

I had thought this would be a cool project, but since Go has http.FileServer function, this turned out to be hell lot easier than I thought it would be, hence, not cool.
